Expand your Search Feature: Currently, you have implemented searching by name. You can expand this to include searching by type, abilities, and other attributes. This will make your Pokédex more versatile.
(Done for now!) Will work om it more later.

Implement Pagination: The PokeAPI returns a lot of data. To make it manageable, you can implement pagination on your backend. This means you’ll only fetch a certain number of Pokémon at a time, which can improve performance.

Error Handling: Make sure to handle potential errors in your requests to the PokeAPI. This could include rate limiting, timeouts, or Pokémon not found.

Caching: To reduce the number of requests to the PokeAPI and speed up your app, you can implement caching. This means you’ll store the results of a request and reuse them if the same request is made again.
